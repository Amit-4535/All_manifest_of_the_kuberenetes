We have different reasons -- for pod is failing from creating..


Pod failure means container is not starting, crashing, or stuck.

1) image issue

- Wrong image name
- Image tag not found
- Private registry without secret

you will get the failed reason of the pod is
- ErrImagePull
- ImagePullBackOff

2) Resource Issues

- Not enough CPU
- Not enough Memory
- Node full
- ResourceQuota exceeded

you will get the pod status as
- Pending
- FailedScheduling


3) Node / Scheduling Issues

- NodeSelector mismatch
- Taints without tolerations
- Node NotReady
- No nodes available


4) Application Crash

- Wrong command/entrypoint
- App exits immediately
- Missing environment variables
- Port conflicts

you will see the status of the pod as

- CrashLoopBackOff
- Error


5) Volume / Storage Issues

- PVC not bound
- StorageClass missing
- Volume mount path wrong


6) Probe Failures

- Liveness probe failing
- Readiness probe failing

  issue is Pod will restarts repeatedly.



7) Security / Permission Issues

- RBAC denies access
- ServiceAccount missing
- SecurityContext restrictions

8) Config / YAML Errors (Pod Level)

- Wrong container name
- Wrong field indentation
- Invalid field values



Note --

Pod fails → Runtime problem
Deployment fails → Management / Configuration problem
