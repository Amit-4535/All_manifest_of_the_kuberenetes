The resource quotta concept are used to set the hard limit of the pods.
set the limit to resources like the CPU limit
set the limit to resource like the memory..


This setting basically are used to the namespace..

it means setting Hard Set = Namespace ResourceQuota.


It controls total resources allowed inside a namespace, not just one pod.


now use this manifest file -- 

apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: my-quota
  namespace: mynamespace
spec:
  hard:
    pods: "10"
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: 2Gi
    limits.cpu: "4"
    limits.memory: 4Gi



  Meaning of Hard Values

Field           	  Meaning
pods: 10	        Max 10 pods allowed in this namespace
requests.cpu: 2	        Total guaranteed CPU across all pods = 2 cores
requests.memory: 2Gi	Total guaranteed memory = 2GB
limits.cpu: 4	        Max CPU usage in namespace = 4 cores
limits.memory: 4Gi	Max memory usage = 4GB


If quota CPU hard limit is 2 and you try to deploy pods needing 3 CPU → Deployment will fail.


“Hard set in Kubernetes is implemented using ResourceQuota, which enforces maximum resource usage limits at the namespace level.”
